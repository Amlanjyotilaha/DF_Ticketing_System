### 3.4 Use Cases

This section describes typical interactions between users and the DF_Ticketing System.

#### Use Case 3.4.1: Employee Submits Reimbursement Request

* **Actor:** Normal User (Employee)

* **Precondition:** Employee is logged into the system.

* **Description:**

  1. Employee navigates to the "Report" module.

  2. Employee clicks "+ New Report" and selects "Reimbursement".

  3. Employee fills in necessary details (e.g., expense type, amount, description).

  4. Employee uploads relevant bills/invoices.

  5. Employee submits the reimbursement request.

* **Postcondition:** A new reimbursement ticket is created with "Pending Manager Approval" status and is visible in the employee's "Report" list.

#### Use Case 3.4.2: Manager Approves a Ticket

* **Actor:** Manager

* **Precondition:** Manager is logged into the system and has pending tickets for approval in "MY TEAM".

* **Description:**

  1. Manager navigates to the "MY TEAM" module.

  2. Manager views the list of tickets awaiting their approval.

  3. Manager selects a specific ticket to review its details and attached documents.

  4. Manager decides to "Approve" or "Reject" the ticket.

  5. If approved, the manager may add comments.

  6. If rejected, the manager must provide a reason.

* **Postcondition:** The ticket status is updated to "Approved by Manager" (if approved) or "Rejected by Manager" (if rejected). The ticket moves to the next stage (Finance Processor) or back to the employee.

#### Use Case 3.4.3: Finance Processes Payment and Uploads UTR

* **Actor:** Finance

* **Precondition:** Finance is logged into the system and has tickets pending payment processing in "FINANCE APPROVAL" or "FINANCE PANEL".

* **Description:**

  1. Finance navigates to "FINANCE APPROVAL" or "FINANCE PANEL".

  2. Finance reviews tickets requiring payment processing.

  3. Finance verifies the details, including approved amount and attached documents.

  4. Finance processes the payment through the bank or relevant system.

  5. Finance uploads the Unique Transaction Reference (UTR) for the payment.

  6. Finance marks the ticket as "Paid" or "Closed".

* **Postcondition:** The ticket status is updated to "Paid" or "Closed", and the UTR is recorded, providing an audit trail.

### 6.1 Logical Architecture

The DF_Ticketing System follows a three-tier logical architecture:

* **Presentation Layer (Frontend):**

  * Developed using **ReactJS**.

  * Responsible for the user interface, user interaction, and displaying data.

  * Communicates with the Application Layer via RESTful API calls using Axios.

  * Handles client-side routing, form validations, and state management.

* **Application Layer (Backend):**

  * Developed using **NodeJS** with **Express.js**.

  * Acts as the core business logic processor.

  * Receives requests from the Presentation Layer, processes them, and interacts with the Data Layer.

  * Handles authentication (JWT), authorization, data validation (express-validator), and file uploads (Multer).

  * Manages workflows (Reimbursement, Procurement, Advance) and business rules.

  * Interacts with external services like email (Nodemailer) and potentially Tally/bank integrations.

* **Data Layer (Database):**

  * Utilizes **MySQL** as the relational database.

  * Stores all persistent data related to users, roles, tickets, workflows, payments, documents, and system configurations.

  * Accessed by the Application Layer to store and retrieve data.

### 6.2 Data Flow

1. **User Interaction:** A user interacts with the **ReactJS Frontend** (e.g., submitting a new reimbursement request).

2. **API Request:** The Frontend sends an asynchronous **REST API** request (via Axios) to the **NodeJS Backend**. This request often includes a JWT for authentication.

3. **Backend Processing:**

   * The Backend receives the request via **Express.js**.

   * It authenticates the user using **JWT**.

   * It validates the incoming data using **express-validator**.

   * If it's a file upload, **Multer** handles the file processing.

   * The backend business logic processes the request, which may involve:

     * Retrieving data from the **MySQL Database**.

     * Storing or updating data in the **MySQL Database**.

     * Triggering an email notification via **Nodemailer** (if applicable).

     * Generating documents (e.g., PO/WO).

4. **Database Interaction:** The Backend performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the **MySQL Database**.

5. **API Response:** The Backend sends a JSON response back to the **ReactJS Frontend**, indicating success or failure and any relevant data.

6. **Frontend Update:** The Frontend receives the response and updates the UI accordingly (e.g., showing a success message using SweetAlert2, updating a list of tickets).
